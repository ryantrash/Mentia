# Mentia, A Mental Health Social Media. 

## Purpose 
We created Mentia as a demo to a solution we see all around us. Teenage mental health is on the decline, and is a serious issue which claims thousands of lives every year. This is a proof-of-concept for an app oriented towards teenagers to express their feelings and vent their frustrations to a safe and inclusive place. Finding the outreach they need through something like social media, which is often critisized for negative effects on mental health, is something which can help turn a negative issue in to a postive force for the community.
